Though a drawback would be that our features would be less interpretable in the sense we wouldn't know what effect the raw features have on the model. Also was might be hard to implement on categorical data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Better hyperparameter tuning - would've liked to have explored the parameter space better and also to have explored more parameters than I did. Also to have run a randomized or grid search on the full dataset instead of a subset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Have a better understanding of some the features to train on, for example I kept `detailed industry recode` as part of my features due to its correlation score, but it served no purpose for the model as on further inspection it contains similar information seen in `major occupation code`. The same may be said for `detailed household and family stat` and `detailed household summary in household`"
